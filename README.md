# Curl Time
Curl Time is a node web server that manages timers for curling matches, as well as a client interface to display and manage those timers. Using Web Sockets, we sync clients with all updates in real-time.

## Goals of this project
- Facilitate easy timekeeping for multiple curling matches
- Allow easy display of one or more time clocks
- Extremely low latency
- Automatic generation of game log
- Full audit log
